## Data Cleaning 
Before delving into data insights, the initial step involved addressing various structural errors within the provided dataset using Power Query. This included column pruning, where unnecessary columns were removed, and utilizing the 'Split Column' feature to restructure multiple columns like 'What Industry do you work in?' and 'Which Title Best Fits your Current Role?' to make the data suitable for analysis. Additionally, a key task was converting salary ranges to a numerical representation. This process entailed extracting numerical values from the salary range and converting them into a numeric format to facilitate the calculation of the average salary.

By thoroughly cleaning the data, the integrity of the dataset was maintained, creating a solid foundation for meaningful analysis.
